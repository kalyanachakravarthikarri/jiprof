<!-- ABSTRACT
For authors: do not include carriage returns/line breaks, HTML tagging, or special 
  characters in the abstract. The abstract should be enticing yet succinct. 
  Aim for 3 to 5 sentences that express why the readers would care about the content 
  (motive) and what he or she can gain from reading the content (benefits). 
  This content also shows up in the "E-mail this page" document option, the META 
  abstract tag, and search results. -->
<abstract>Your article abstract goes here. Put the main points and key phrases at the beginning of the abstract, because it may be truncated in search results. Make your abstract enticing yet succinct. Aim for three to five sentences that express why the reader would care about the content (motive) and what he or she can gain from reading the content (benefits).</abstract>

<!-- ABSTRACT-EXTENDED
For developerWorks staff use only. If you need HTML tagging or special characters 
  in the abstract, or want to include more than 5 sentences, fill in the 
  abstract-extended IN ADDITION to the abstract. When both are filled 
  in, the abstract is used in "E-mail this page", the META abstract tag, and
  search results, while the abstract-extended appears in the article itself. -->
<abstract-extended>Your article abstract goes here. Put the main points and key phrases at the beginning of the abstract, because it may be truncated in search results. Include symbols for any trademarked terms, such as Java<trade/> or WebSphere<reg/>, as well as any HTML tagging needed for <i>highlighting</i> or linking to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks">related developerWorks content</a>.  If this article is part of a series, always point the reader to the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/linux/libraryview.jsp?topic_by=All+topics+and+related+products&amp;sort_order=asc&amp;lcl_sort_order=asc&amp;search_by=IPC+apps&amp;search_flag=true&amp;type_by=Articles&amp;show_abstract=false&amp;sort_by=Relevance&amp;end_no=100&amp;show_all=false">entire series</a>.</abstract-extended>

<!-- START OF ARTICLE BODY
For authors: your article can contain paragraphs, major headings, minor headings, 
  code listings, images, tables, sidebars, lists, and highlighting. 

  Do not copy or cut and paste text from word processors such as 
  Microsoft Word. The encoding method they use (even if UTF-8) 
  will create invalid characters in the resulting HTML.  Instead, 
  save the Word document as a text file and then copy the text.  -->

<docbody>

<!-- PARAGRAPH 
For authors: every paragraph needs a beginning and ending tag. -->
<p>Learn how to code the various content elements you can use 
in your article:</p>

<!-- LIST  
For authors: you can include ordered (ol) and unordered (ul) 
  lists anywhere in your article.  If you have an ordered list 
  interrupted by a heading and want the numbering to 
  continue, use the start attribute. For example, to resume 
  the list at number 6, use <ol start="6">. -->

<!-- MAJOR HEADING 
For authors: major headings appear in the table of contents (TOC)   
  that is automatically generated (left nav). If you need to refer to 
  this heading, fill in a refname; otherwise, leave refname blank. 
  If you want a different or shorter heading to appear in the 
  TOC, put it in the alttoc attribute. 
  If the rule and "Back to top" link at the bottom of the text under
  this major heading overwrite the right column in IE, use the optional 
  back-to-top attribute, set to "no" as shown below. -->
<heading alttoc="" refname="" type="major" back-to-top="no">Headings</heading>

<p><i>Major headings</i> appear in the content list in the left nav; this list is 
automatically generated.  <i>Minor headings</i> organize major sections 
into smaller units and do not appear in the content list.</p>

<heading alttoc="" refname="" type="major">Lists</heading>

<p>You can include ordered (&lt;ol&gt;) and unordered (&lt;ul&gt;) lists anywhere in your article.
Your lists can include code listings, tables, and figures (such as a screenshot 
in a numbered procedure).  In these cases, code the listing, table, or figure inside 
the closing list item tag (&lt;/li&gt;).  You can also include lists inside blockquotes (&lt;blockquote&gt;).</p>
        
<heading alttoc="" refname="code-hd" type="major">Code listings</heading>
    
<p><a name="code-text">Code listings</a> are common in developerWorks content. 
Limit code lines to no more than 90 characters. See the scale in <a href="#listing1">Listing 1</a> 
below; you should temporarily set your editor's font to Courier or some other monospace 
font when checking line lengths. For longer code lines, you must find suitable places 
to split the lines; long lines do not autowrap. Code lines longer than 90 characters will 
truncate printed-copy text (in typical portrait layout).</p>
<!-- CODE SECTION
For authors: you can include code listings to illustrate your points. 

Limit code lines to no more than 90 characters. See the scale in the example below; 
you should temporarily set your editor's font to Courier or some other monospace 
font when checking line lengths. For longer code lines, you must find suitable places 
to split the lines; long lines do not autowrap. Code lines longer than 90 characters will 
truncate printed-copy text (in typical portrait layout). When counting characters, count 
the blanks too, but count symbols or character entities like "&lt;" and "&quot;" as a 
single character; they will resolve to one character when transformed and published. 

For the code listing itself, type or paste in ASCII code with proper keyboard spacing.  
Use the space key to indent lines. Use &lt; to represent a less-than symbol and &gt; to 
represent a greater-than symbol. Use &amp; for an ampersand.  If needed for clarity, 
use <b> and </b> for bold text, as shown below. 

Include a caption ("heading") for each code listing.  

The code section width defaults to full-page width (100%), but if you need to avoid 
overlaying a sidebar, you can make the code listing narrower, say with a width of 65%.  
Reducing the width does not split long lines; if line length exceeds the width you set, 
your width setting is ignored. -->

<code type="section" width="100%">
<heading refname="listing1" type="code">Listing 1. Sample code listing at maximum width</heading>
&lt;!-- Please limit code lines to 90 characters max. --&gt;
&lt;!-- The following line is the max length: --&gt;
|-------10--------20--------30--------40--------50--------60--------70--------80--------90

</code>

<heading alttoc="" refname="" type="major">Inline code and other highlighting</heading>

<!-- INLINE CODE (code within a sentence) and HIGHLIGHTING
For authors: when a sentence includes the name of a command, 
  class, object, method, code snippet, or anything the user types 
  in, use the inline (monospace) code font. -->
<p>Use <code type="inline">monospace code font</code> (&lt;code type="inline"&gt;) 
for names of commands, such as the  <code type="inline">make 
install</code> command, as well as for classes, objects, 
methods, code snippets, and any text the user types in.</p>

<p>You can also use <b>bold</b> (&lt;b&gt;) for emphasis, and <i>italics</i> (&lt;i&gt;) 
for clarity in text.  For example, use bold for warnings or cautions 
("do <b>not</b> press Enter"), and use italics for terms defined in content 
(<i>Major headings</i> appear...").</p>

<heading alttoc="" refname="" type="major">Sidebars, figures, and tables</heading>

<p>You can include sidebars, figures, and tables in your article.</p>

<!-- MINOR HEADING 
For authors: minor headings organize major sections into 
  smaller units, and do not appear in the table of contents. 
  If you need to refer to this heading, fill in a refname; otherwise, 
  leave refname blank. -->
<heading alttoc="" refname="sidebars" type="minor">Sidebars</heading>

<!-- SIDEBAR 
For authors: you can include sidebars anywhere in the body of 
  your article, but make sure their placement does not collide with 
  code listings, tables, or other elements. The 
  heading is recommended but not required. Sidebars default to 
  right alignment and 40% width, but you can change those optionally. -->
<sidebar width="">
<heading refname="" type="sidebar">When to use a sidebar</heading>
Use a sidebar for a content detour or reinforcement.  For example, you 
might define terms or provide a bit of historical background in a sidebar. 
Or you might summarize the key points of a lengthy discussion. See a sidebar 
in action in "<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-c99.html">Open 
source development using C99</a>".
</sidebar>

<p>Technical graphics such as screen captures, diagrams, and photographs 
can enhance and help explain your content. To learn how to create and deliver 
effective graphics, read 
"<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/i-dwgraphics/">Illustrating 
your article or tutorial for developerWorks</a>".</p>
<!-- FIGURE 
For authors:  you can include graphics anywhere in the 
  sections of a article. Use the heading tag to provide a 
  caption. The alt attribute on the img tag is required. 
  Images should be in gif or jpg format, and no wider 
  than is needed to convey a concept, up to a maximum 
  of 572 pixels. If you include the figure in a list, such as a 
  screenshot in a numbered procedure, code the figure 
  inside the list item, like this:
  <ol>
	<li>Select the Java Beans view, as shown in the following figure: 
	<figure>
		<heading refname="" type="" alttoc="">Caption</heading>
		<img alt="" src=""></img>
	</figure>
	</li>
  </ol>   
  For additional advice, see "Illustrating your article or tutorial for developerWorks" 
  at: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/i-dwgraphics/ -->
<figure>
<heading refname="fig1" type="figure" alttoc="">Figure 1. The Java Beans view</heading>
<img src="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ecvisual/JBView.gif" 
width="211" height="168" alt="The Java Beans view" />
</figure>

<heading refname="" type="major">Tables</heading>

<p>Use any of the following styles for tables in your article.  
<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> uses a traditional heading-style caption 
and left-aligned columns.  Table 1 is the recommended style, because its 
caption treatment matches that of figures and code listings.</p>

<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> uses a caption tag, instead of a heading-style 
caption. If you prefer this style of caption, that's fine. Just be consistent in using this 
caption style for tables throughout your article.  Note also that references to these 
tables work a little differently: in the absence of a heading with a refname attribute that 
you can refer to, you must add an anchor tag with a name attribute 
(&lt;a name="table2" /&gt;) above the table. (Your developerWorks editor can 
help you with coding your tables and references.)</p>

<p>Regardless of which caption treatment you use for tables (captions coded as 
headings as in Table 1 or captions coded with the caption tag as in Table 2), stick 
with the same style throughout a single article.</p>

<p>Tables 3 through 5 also show you other variations on column alignment and 
row color.  You can add these variations to any style of table.</p> 
     
<!-- TABLE
For authors: you can include tables anywhere in your article. 
Each table needs a caption; use either the heading tag (preferred) or 
the caption tag for the caption. -->

        ALL COLUMNS LEFT-ALIGNED -->
        <heading refname="table1" type="table">Table 1. Table using

<!-- LINKING TO OTHER SECTIONS OF THE ARTICLE  
For authors: as needed, link to other headings, figures, code listings, 
tables, or text as shown here: 
  - To link to resources or downloads (standard headings), use 
        <a href="#resources">Resources</a> or 
        <a href="#downloads">Downloads</a>.    
  - To link to a heading, figure, code listing, or table, use 
        <a href="#xxx">Heading</a>
        <a href="#xxx">Figure 1</a>
        <a href="#xxx">Listing 1</a>
        <a href="#xxx">Table 1</a>
     where "xxx" is the refname on the heading (figures, code listings, 
     and tables use headings to add their captions).
  - To link to a table that uses the caption tag instead of a heading-style caption, 
     use 
        <a href="#xxx">Table 1</a> 
     where "xxx" is coded in <a name="xxx" /> just above the table.
  - To link to stand-alone text, use <a href="#xxx">, where "xxx" is an anchor 
     at the target text (as in <a name="xxx">target text</a>).

<p>To keep readers engaged with your content, and not 
wandering away mid-article to pursue some other author's  
content, try to <b>minimize off-site links</b> in the body of your article.   
Instead, in the body, link to the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> 
heading and include related content (articles, tutorials, developerWorks 
downloads, views, technical briefings, Webcasts, demos, books, Web sites, 
or offers) and urls there.  Likewise, for code downloads and demos, don't include 
the urls in the body; rather, link to the <a href="#download">Downloads</a> 
section and include the urls there.</p>
         
<p>On the other hand, <b>link freely to elements within the article</b>, such as 
headings, figures, code listings, and tables, <b>and to other developerWorks content</b>, 
especially if the article is part of a series. For serial content, include at least one link 
to the entire series in the body of the article. (In addition, include a link to the entire 
series in the abstract and Resources section.)</p>
         
<p>To sum up, you can include these types of links in the body of your article:</p>         
 
<ul>

<li><b>Link to "Resources"</b>: 
See the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section for a link.<br /><br /></li>

<li><b>Link to "Downloads"</b>:
See the <a href="#download">Downloads</a> section to download the code.<br /><br /></li>

<li><b>Link to a heading</b>: 
See how to add sidebars to your article in <a href="#sidebars">Sidebars</a>.<br /><br /></li>
        
<li><b>Link to a code listing</b>: 
See <a href="#listing1">Listing 1</a> for a sample code listing.<br /><br /></li>
        
<li><b>Link to a figure</b>: 
See <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> for a sample screenshot.<br /><br /></li>
  
<li><b>Link to a table</b>: 
See <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> for a sample table.<br /><br /></li>

<!--  RESOURCES
For authors (optional but recommended): include links 
  to Web content cited in the article, as well as links 
  to other related articles, tutorials, developerWorks 
  downloads, views, Web sites, forums, blogs, tech briefings, 
  Webcasts, demos, books, or offers related to the topic. 
  Aim for 7 to 12 resources sorted into the categories of 
  "Learn," "Get products and technologies," and "Discuss." 
  
  In the resulting article, resources appear in the "Resources" 
  section at the end of the article. Resource items are grouped into 
  categories, provided: 
  - You have at least three resource elements, total
  - You have at least one item in at least two categories  
  Even if the resources are not clustered by category in the xml file, 
  they will be in the html.
  
  Resources can be on developerWorks, alphaWorks, IBM 
  product or research sites, or non-IBM sites. Do NOT include 
  links to download files related to the article (use target-content-file 
  above), nor links to a discussion forum URL if you coded the 
  <forum-url> element (this link will be added automatically). 
  
  The developerWorks staff will adjust the tactic code (S_TACT) 
  and campaign code (S_CMP) as needed; these codes are 
  required on urls for trial downloads, tutorials, offers, and 
  technical events.
